# Computing History Podcast

These are the scripts and tools for my computing history podcast, a multi-year effort to describe the "BC" part of computing history, as in, the technology and times that *led to the computer*. 

For instance, the first 8 episodes are in the 1700s and deal with early electromagnetic theory and hypothesis of telegraphs.

Why? Well before you had electric communication protocols you needed electric communications so let's look at that. To do that you need electric wires ... so where did those come from? What about electricity itself? Telegraphs? etc ... this is the process.

Theres *some* literature on this and *some* precedent but never with this goal. This is the first effort to pull it all together that I know of.

Give it a listen at http://comphistpod.com ... thanks!
