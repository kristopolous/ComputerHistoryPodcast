Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.1, the dream of electric
communications.

Electronic communication, it's how we directed the Voyager 1 space
craft, far past the orbit of Neptune to snap a final photo of earth so we could see our planet as a pale blue dot suspended in a sunbeam.

It's also how components communicate that are so incredibly tiny that if they
had legs, it would take them around 3 hours to walk across a single grain of sand.

Even more astounding is these two things and everything in between speak
nearly the same electronic language.

So where did this all start?

The basic idea is to be able to efficiently communicate at a distance.
Humans have had ways of doing that using coded symbols for thousands of
years. Alphabets, smoke signals, mirrors reflecting the sunlight, many
methods were developed.

Each of these examples are of different medium. For instance, with an
alphabet, a surface is marked with symbols and then you just need to worry
about the caring for and transporting of the marked surface.

We're going to start our story with the fantasy of communicating using the medium of electricity.

In the same way we talk about currently unachievable
technology, such as visiting other galaxies, to the dreamers of the 18th
century, electronic communication was a hope and a vision capturing the
imaginations of the telegraph pioneers.

These machines of science fiction were described in detail often with excited H.G. Wells style
flourishes over about 70 years before the first working telegraph was achieved
and that one only extended to the inventor's garden.

This week we'll be looking at these futurist luminaries who dreamed of a telegraphic world connecting people in a way that
made their distance irrelevant empowering them to have, even casual conversations
spanning over vast oceans.

If you were alive in 1753 living in Edinburgh you may have been a reader of
general Scots Magazine. In their February issue of that year among the
contents you would see the speeches in debate upon a subsidy to the King of
Poland, whether a reformed rake, a man of sense or a man of good nature ought
to be a preferred husband and an expeditious method of conveying intelligence
by means of electricity.

Although the article about the reformed rakes is quite good, we'll be looking
at the electricity one.

Written by, well, nobody quite knows, someone named C.M., who started with a curious
observation:

"It is well known to all who are conversant in electrical experiments that
electric power may be propagated along a smile wire, from one place to another
without being sensibly abated by the length of its progress.

Now this is not going to sound like the single wire with the dots and dashes
that you've all heard about, so pay attention

Let, then, a set of wires, equal in
number to the letters of the alphabet, be extended
horizontally between two given places, parallel to one
another, and each of them about an inch distant from
that next to it. At every twenty yards' end, let them
be fixed in glass, or jeweller's cement, to some firm
body, both to prevent them from touching the earth,
or any other non-electric, and from breaking by their
own gravity. Let the electric gun-barrel be placed at
right angles with the extremities of the wires, and
about an inch below them. Also let the wires be
fixed in a solid piece of glass, at six inches from the
end; and let that part of them which reaches from 
the glass to the machine have sufficient spring and 
stiffness to recover its situation after having been 
brought in contact with the barrel. Close by the 
supporting glass, let a ball be suspended from every 
wire ; and about a sixth or an eighth of an inch below 
the balls, place the letters of the alphabet, marked on 
bits of paper, or any other substance that may be light 
enough to rise to the electrified ball ; and at the same 
time let it be so contrived, that each of them may re- 
assume its proper place when dropt.* 

"All things constructed as above, and the minute 
previously fixed, I begin the conversation with my 
distant friend in this manner. Having set the electrical 
machine a-going as in ordinary experiments, suppose 
I am to pronounce the word Sir ; with a piece of 
glass, or any other electric per se, I strike the wire S, 
so as to bring it in contact wtth the barrel, then i, then 
r, all in the same way ; and my correspondent, almost 
in the same instant, observes these several characters 
rise in order to the electrified balls at his end of the 
wires. Thus I spell away as long as I think fit ; and 
my correspondent, for the sake of memory, writes the 
characters as they rise, and may join and read them 
afterwards as often as he inclines. Upon a signal 
given, or from choice, I stop the machine ; and, taking 
up the pen in my turn, I write down whatever my 
friend at the other end strikes out. 

Are you still with me? Did you follow all that? The suggestion was to have
small pieces of paper with letters written on them jumping up, via static
electricity to tiny electrified balls, one for each letter, and
then fluttering back down one by one as the remote observer diligently
records what letters hit their balls in what order. 

Ah, the familiar electronic telegraph. Why, what were you expecting? 
A single wire you say? Don't be silly! How would that even
work?! Why clearly there needs to be a separate individual wire for every letter of the
alphabet. If your language has a different number of letters than you'll
simply need a different number of wires.

"Well didn't it occur to anyone to just hook up a speaker and use some kind of coded
system instead?" Huh? What's an electric speaker? they'd say. This is 1753. That's
over 100 years away.

The giants upon whose shoulders you wish to stand upon have yet to be born.
We continue:

"If anybody should think this way tiresome, let
him, instead of the balls, suspend a range of bells
from the roof, equal in number to the letters of the
alphabet ; gradually decreasing in size from the bell
A to Z ; and from the horizontal wires, let there be
another set reaching to the several bells ; one, viz.,
from the horizontal wire A to the bell A, another from
the horizontal wire B to the bell B, &c. Then let him
who begins the discourse bring the wires in contact
with the barrel, as before ; and the electrical spark,
breaking on bells of different size, will inform his
correspondent by the sound what wires have been
touched. And thus, by some practice, they may come
to understand the language of the chimes in whole
words, without being put to the trouble of noting
down every letter."

We only have this one letter. There is no machine, any evidence of one
constructed, or even any knowledge as to who the author was. People have been
searching for who CM was since 1753. Maybe it was a woman scientist hiding in
the shadows or prehaps someone who deeply believed in the possibility of the
telegraph but had nothing to show but failed implementations and used the veil
of anonymity to hide their shame.  

Regardless here was the first glimpse we had of the electric communication.

But wait, there's 10 more to go before 1800, none of them having any evidence
of ever working. Like a quack in a garage working on a time machine,
someone claiming to be getting close to a working electric telegraph could
have been readily dismissed and regarded as an ignorant fool throughout the 
remainder of the 1700s.

So we'll follow this futile quackery of communicating via electricity down to
southern Europe at the College of Rome where a lecturer on natural philosophy
(let's call it science), Joseph Bozolus suggested such a device based on spark
in 1767.  He described it in Latin, via poetry in a text called the
Electicorum.

Being poetry he doesn't go into too much detail but it's basically bury two
insulated wires, keep them close together, charge the wire at one end to
create a spark at the other. The encoding is left as an exercise to the
reader.

This is far closer then paper strips clinging to electrostatic balls but it
also doesn't seem to have ever been built.

Now if an alphabet of bells and a latin poem wasn't enough color in 1773 a
Genevan Physician named Louis Odier was trying to pick up a lady and thought
he could do it by talking about his telegraph idea.  He wrote to her:

" I shall amuse you, perhaps, in telling you that I
have in my head certain experiments by which to
enter into conversation with the emperor of Mogol,
or of China, the English, the French, or any other
people of Europe, in a way that, without incon-
veniencing yourself, you may intercommunicate all
that you wish, at a distance of four or five thousand
leagues in less than half an hour ! Will that suffice
you for glory . There is nothing more real. What- 
ever be the course of those experiments, they must 
necessarily lead to some grand discovery ; but I have 
not the courage to undertake them this winter.'

Figures. Nice try Louis. He also doesn't seem to have built it.

Round 4 brings us to Alessandro Volta. Now you should notice by this dude's
name "Volta" that he's probably where unit of Volts came from and is therefore 
likely to be pretty important when it comes to electricity. His experiments
weren't disclosed until research done by someone named, and remember this
name, Francis Ronalds, who at the age of 85 wrote into the first edition of
the first journal of the society of telegraphe engineers about Volta having
described a nearly working telegraph in 1777. 

It was however, mostly hype. It did contain some genuinely good future
thought. An excerpt of the translated letter is as follows:

"he more I reflect, the more I see the beautiful 
experiments that can be made by means of the spark 
in exploding the electric pistol at any distance. An 
iron wire, stretched along the fields, or roads, for I 
know not how many miles, could . conduct the spark. 
As, however, in long distances moist earth and water- 
courses would be encountered, which would draw off 
the electric fire, the wire may be supported on posts 
placed at regular intervals"

He, however, just like everyone else didn't actually build an infrastructure
of posts with wires although someone eventually did. 

Our 5th telegraph proposal, coming from the May 30th 1782 Journal of Paris brings forth a very important insight to the history of computers.

Along with being yet another dream in a line of unbuilt machines, it was the
first to describe an electronic encoding in details. The first electronic
format is described here in 1782, a designation of code designed for electricity. 

We even get a suggestion of binary, byte and a primitive form of compression
using what is called a lookup or reference table. Of course these words hadn't
been appropriated yet and so we are applying this analysis with a
contemporary lens, but let's go on.

The anonymous author starts by describing a hybrid system between the Scottish
CM and a spark system. They propose a pair of wires for every
letter of the alphabet placed close against a tin and then
observing the spark between the wire and the tin for each letter. But the
method of observation would be by creating little knobs on a panel, each one
will illuminate upon spark. Those old computers with all the blinking lights?
Yes, that's what they are thinking of using 1780s technology.

The author goes on, identifying that having 48 wires (2 for each letter) would
be somewhat impractical so they propose as follows:

"These means could be simplified by having having only 5 pairs of wires and
attaching a character or letter to each of their combination as in, firing
multiple wires as once, which would make 31 characters; six pairs would yield
63 and thus one could arrive at a sort of shorthand or fast writing with one
combination sufficing for an entire word or phrase. There would be some
difficulty however in discharging at exactly the same instant several pairs.
One might also use successive combinations of these pairs in which 5 pairs
would give 125 signals and 6 216 which would be very fast"

Woah hold on here ... what did we just read? 

First there's a suggestion of a byte, in this case having 5 or 6 bits. The
author correctly identifies the number of combinations and that timing is
absolutely essential in making it work and also quite hard. Then they describe 
what is called serial communication in the computing world to avoid the timing issue,
essentially stagnating the symbols into a stream.

These are both absolutely essential ideas in computing. If this was it, we
could stop here, take our ball and go home. But there's even more.  In
computing we separate control and data. That is to say we need a way to say
something will begin an then we begin that something. Then we need a way to
say something is ending. It's a crucial separation in any protocol design so
our 18th century proto-computer scientist of course includes that as well

"It would be necessary to give each correspondent 
a means of notifying that he wished to communicate, 
to prevent constant watching and cross signalling. 
For this an electric bell would suffice, and by agree- 
ing beforehand that one stroke shall mean ' I will 
call you up in 15 minutes,' two strokes ' I am all 
attention,' etc., all confusion would be avoided."

And then, like someone who just wandered in a room and casually defeated
everyone while yawning and checking their watch, our author concludes:

"As this letter is only intended for those who
amuse themselves with physics, they can easily supply
for themselves all the details that I have omitted."

Maybe they were anonymous because they were a time traveler.

Our author #5 wasn't seen as that groundbreaking at the time however as the
editor notied:

His project of an easy communication between two very distant places appears
to be only the the dream of some pleasant trifler. It is, however, not new,
and would only imperfectly accomplish its object;

Oh pish posh.

Now if you thought our anonymous author sounded like the fantasies of a computer
programmer, telegraph fever dream #6 will come from someone who acted like
one.

Georges Louis Le Sage was born in Geneva in 1724 to strict academic parents and after hopping around many scientific
disciplines he tried his way as a doctor but was forbidden from practicing
in Geneva after acquiring his medical degree in Paris for the sole reason
that his father was not a Genevan. These were stranger times.

Giving up on medicine Goerge sought a study of mathematics, against his
fathers will, but wasn't able to get a university position. Ah the college
dropout syndrome.

Le Sage was an interesting guy. He described his manner of working in the 
following ways:

I have been born with four dispositions well adapted for making progress in science, but with two great defects in the faculties necessary for that purpose. 1. An ardent desire to know the truth; 2. Great activity of mind; 3. An uncommon soundness of understanding; 4. A strong desire for precision and distinctness of ideas; 5. An excessive weakness of memory; 6. A great incapacity of continued attention.

He also suffered from insomnia and often slept throughout the day. If you ever
wondered what computer programmer types did before computers, well here's your chance to find out.

He describes essentially a clone of the CM system but uses separate tubing for
each wire, and uses gold leaf instead of slips of paper. 

Which is not that remarkable until you find out what he does next. Of course
like the others Le Sage doesn't actually have the resources to build the thing
but this time, that doesn't stop him. 

Instead he tries his hand at raising a round of venture capital - of course
like our other phrases, this had yet to be named that. Where does he go for
such wealth in the 1780s? Well the King of Prussia of course:

 Sire, — My little fortune is not only sufficient for
all my wants, but even for all my tastes — except one,
viz., that of contributing to the wants and tastes of
others ; and this desire all the monarchs of the world,
united, could not enable me to fully satisfy. It is
not, then, to a patron who can give much, that I take
the liberty of dedicating the following discovery, but
to a patron who can do much with it, and who can
judge for himself of its utility without having to refer
it to his advisers.

And then he attached diagrams and descriptions, like a enlightenment era pitch
deck and waited for a response. 

There's no evidence on the Prussian side so like most startup aspirations, his angel
investor, in his case, the king of prussia, failed to materialize.

However the author goes on to describe using multiple wires at once:

Where this all started is 
 

He was an avid tinkerer and came up with a machine that could communicate by
electricity over wire. We'd call it a telegraph.

If George 


So here we are, it's 1816 and we have a telegraph based on a compass where the
dial will spin around to a letter instead of to the north. It's not at all 
that different than what was first described in the anonymous letter  60 years
prior although we unfortunately do not get the lovely bells to go along with
it.
