Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.1, the dream of electric
communications.

Electronic communication, it's how we directed the Voyager 1 space
craft, far past the orbit of Neptune to snap a final photo of earth so we could see our planet as a pale blue dot suspended in a sunbeam.

It's also how components communicate that are so incredibly tiny that if they
had legs, it would take them around 3 hours to walk across a single grain of sand.

Even more astounding is these two things and everything in between speak
nearly the same electronic language.

So where did this all start?

The basic idea is to be able to efficiently communicate at a distance.
Humans have had ways of doing that using coded symbols for thousands of
years. Alphabets, smoke signals, mirrors reflecting the sunlight, many
methods were developed.

Each of these examples are of different medium. For instance, with an
alphabet, a surface is marked with symbols and then you just need to worry
about the caring for and transporting of the marked surface.

We're going to start our story with the fantasy of communicating using the medium of electricity.

In the same way we talk about currently unachievable
technology, such as visiting other galaxies, to the dreamers of the 18th
century, electronic communication was a hope and a vision capturing the
imaginations of the telegraph pioneers.

These machines of science fiction were described in detail often with excited H.G. Wells style
flourishes over about 70 years before the first working telegraph was achieved
and that one only extended to the inventor's garden.

This week we'll be looking at these futurist luminaries who dreamed of a telegraphic world connecting people in a way that
made their distance irrelevant empowering them to have, even casual conversations
spanning over vast oceans.

Our story begins 
Where this all started is 
 

We start our story in Geneva in 1724 where Georges Louis Le Sage who was
born to strict academic parents and after hopping around many scientific
disciplines he tried his way as a doctor but was forbidden from practicing
in Geneva after acquiring his medical degree in Paris for the sole reason
that his father was not a Genevan. These were stranger times.

Giving up on medicine Goerge sought a study of mathematics, against his
fathers will, but wasn't able to get a university position.

He was an avid tinkerer and came up with a machine that could communicate by
electricity over wire. We'd call it a telegraph.


Louis Odier Geneva, 1773
" I shall amuse you, perhaps, in telling you that I
have in my head certain experiments by which to
enter into conversation with the emperor of Mogol,
or of China, the English, the French, or any other
people of Europe, in a way that, without incon-
veniencing yourself, you may intercommunicate all
that you wish, at a distance of four or five thousand
leagues in less than half an hour ! Will that suffice
you for glory .'
If George 


So here we are, it's 1816 and we have a telegraph based on a compass where the
dial will spin around to a letter instead of to the north. It's not at all 
that different than what was first described in the anonymous letter  60 years
prior although we unfortunately do not get the lovely bells to go along with
it.
