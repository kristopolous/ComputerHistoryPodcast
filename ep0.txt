Hello and welcome to computing history episode 0, preview

When talking about computer history there's really a number of independent
timelines that should be studied. The modern computer wouldn't have
been possible without all these at one time, pretty  independent timelines
coming together.

Let's first take a step back and look at what a computer is. We'll use
a modern smartphone taking a photograph for consideration.  

When a person takes a photo with a smartphone some carefully manufactured
light sensors are translating light into electrical signals. And here we
get our first timeline.

Reliable, precise large scale manufacturing methods using almost completely
error free materials has taken centuries of progress. Modern computing
requires not only the machines of production but the process, methodology and
quality control to do the production. This is one of the timeline we'll be
covering.

Now back to the smart phone.  After the sensors convert the light into
electricity it then traverses around through small wires laid out on a 
circuit board visiting various other integrated circuits. The technology of
addressing, networking, and relaying messages started during the era of
telegraphs and really got off the ground with automatic switching of
telephones that didn't require an operator. The technical achivements in
these complex communication networks throughout the first half of the 20th
century were crucial in the move from addresses with phone numbers to
addresses with electrons coming from a camera. The history of networked
communications is the first timeline we'll be going over, starting in the mid
1800s and going up to the start of WW2.

What happens inside the little black caterpillar looking chips is roughly
called computing or processing. Generally this is mechanized mathematics. The
work that is done inside these black boxes can be simplified down to tiny
silicon machines which have their roots in mechanical arithmatic machines 
that go back to the Renaissance. That will be another timeline.

Now it's not just the mechanics of the arithmatic that matter here but the
kind of arithmatic that was done. Mathematicians and academics play a crucial
role in the history of computers. It is very much the case that the modern
computer were first described not as real world machines but as elaborate 
mathematical problems so ther will be rather non-technical history of the 
math history.

Now going back to the photograph, yes, we are still talking about that. When
the processing is done the phone then places it in storage. These days,
computer storage on a phone is yet another little black rectangle. That's
a very modern idea. Being able to store information for later use by a machine
is another long history. You may even have a machine and storage device in your 
home that hasn't significantly changed since the 1770s. I'm pretty sure everyone 
listening has held these machines in their hands, and fed the recorded data
into the machine without even thinking about it. I'm talking about the
innocent windup music box. The history of storage is a separate timeline we'll
also be going over.

Now all of these technologies in our photo example wouldn't be very useful if the 
user couldn't conduct the smartphone to do things. This is of course done
through software.  Software, roughly, is the ability to redefine the operation
of a device after its manufacturing. There's a gray line really between
configuring say, a 19th century calculator and then turning the gear to do the
calculation and the first widely agreed upon defintion of programmable
machines. There's also a couple decades. The idea of reconfiguration as a form
of software will also be covered up to the late 1930s.

And finally none of these things came cheap. The raw materials have to be
mined or salvaged, then they have to be processed and assembled according to
careful chip designs refined over decades by thousands of people. Then software 
written by a different army of engineers gets installed on to the device. The
business and finance side is also important. Series A, B, C financing, angel
investors, startups, stock options, the history of how the operation of
computer and mechanical brain building was financed is also crucial. Many of
the ambitious early machine projects, such as the famous 1800s computer by Charles
Babbage proved to be to expensive and the business innovations to overcome
those costs did not exist yet. The technology of business is also important.

Long before Apple and Microsoft and even before the code breaking machines of
World War 2, the computer revolution was taking shape in business,
communications, tabulation, recording, manufacturing, mathematics, and
reconfigurable systems. This series intends to go over all of them. Yes, all
of them, one by one, as long as it takes.

It is a large project and it has never been done before. And that is exactly
why I am doing it. So join me soon in episode 1.1 of computing history, the
victorian internet or as they would have called it, the
