"I wish to inform you of a new, but terrible experiment, which I advise you on no account personally to attempt. I am engaged in a research to determine the strength of electricity.

Leyden Jar

In 1746, for example Abbe Nollet, there he is again, in order to try to measure the speed of electricity, got 200 monks to form a circle stretching over a mile. They each held iron rods between each other similarly to Grey's 2 boy experiments. Then Nollet discharged the leyden jar over the 200 monks and observers noted that all of them convulsed from the intense shock at nearly, but not exactly the same time, showing the electricity speed is finite, but extremely high.

"It caused great wonder and dread, which arose chiefly from the excited imagination. Musschenbroek felt the shock, and declared in a letter to a friend that he would not take a second one for the crown of France.

Bleeding at the nose, ardent fever, a heaviness of head which endured for days, were all ascribed to the shock. Boze wished that he might die of it, so the he might enjoy the honor of having his death chronicled in the Paris' Academy of Science.

In 1746, Nollet transmitted the charge of
a Leyden jar a distance of 900 toises [about 1(3/4) km].
To do so, he enlisted a community of monks to form a
circle, with iron wires connecting adjacent monks. At the
moment of discharge, all the monks jumped up

Ludolph, electric shock party trick

So before we return to Leiden we'll be swinging by Berlin to visit Ewald George von Kleist who came up with something called, ok let's try this, Kliest chee fla sche, Kliest Flask, or Kliest Bottle, this will quickly be superceded within months. The best description I've found of this is from an 1881 text by Tyndall so indulge me for a bit:

Priestley says (" Discovery of Germans,
"
that Gordon
increased the electric sparks to such a degree that
they were felt from a man's head to his foot, so that a person could
hardly take them without falling down with giddiness; and small
birds were killed by them.
This he effected by conveying elec-
tricity, with iron wires, to the distance of 200 ells (about 250 yards)
is
from the place of excitation."
