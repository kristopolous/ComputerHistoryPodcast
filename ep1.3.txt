Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.3, the journey to the
electric wire.

Day sa goo lee ae

Prior to our floating alphabetic rips of paper we discussed in 1.1, an early
scientist Stephen Gray, was responsible for the experiments we're
going to be discussing today. Sorry, the supposedly working telegraph 
promise given at the end of 1.1 will have to wait for a future episode.

When I call Stephen Grey an early scientist, I do mean it. The word scientist was first used in
1834 by the english polymath William Hewl. Our modern cognitive perimeters we
place around phrases such as math and science are pretty contemporary. In the
1700s people considered many more things, such as commerce and music to fall
under the umbrella labeled science. That's because science as an institution
and a discipline was still forming at the time. Stephen
Gray however, really sounds like someone who would fit strongly inside even our
more restricted modern notions of science

It's hard to know what to think about Stephen Gray. In A History of Science, 
published in 1904, Henry Williams referred to him as an irascible old
pensioner. Over on Wikipedia you can read that he was a relatively unknown 
shadow of his friend John Theophilus Desaguliers who stole the limelight 
over factional differences between Flamsteed and Newton - Newton, did you know
he was an actual irascible scoundrel? A great scientist but also kind of an
bellicose intellectual pirate. We'll be going over his colorful spats in the
first supplemental, hopefully next week. Newton died a childless bachelor. Was
that because he was secretly what we classify today as asexual or homosexual? 
Or was it because he was just that insufferable to be around? There's 
actually evidence for both, and maybe they're both true. it'll be fun listen, next time.

Anyway back to Grey. If you read Desaguliers "A Dissertation Concerning Electricity", from 
1742, a list of 24 different experiments to observe the phenomena of electricity, the
author speaks quite glowingly of Stephen Gray who by then had been dead for 6
years. Gray even lived with Desagulier for about 4 years in the 1710s. In his 
later letters in the 1720s he speaks of corresponding with Desagulier regularly.  
In his various publications he seems far more interested in science and 
experimentation than essentially anything else.

I like to think of Gray as an excited science nerd without social graces. A
Steve Urkel of 18th century London. He died a childless bachelor at the age of
70 spending at least 30 years publishing early science works spanning from
astronomy, optics, and most importantly electricity. He was never a rich man
and had to have someone else vouch for him and cover his dues at the royal
society, the place to go for science in the day. 

I kinda think of him as one of those really smart people you may know who drives
around in a beat up old car, always working on interesting projects and
doesn't seem to really care much about money or status. A person who keeps the company
of respected people and is well-respected by them, but to everyone else, is
just some scraggly wanderer completely captured by his hobbies.  Not a bad
life...

Gray's impoverishment may have actually worked in his favor because being on a
small budget, his science experiments ended up often being wickedly clever, using
pretty common things and thus being easily repeatable. He may have helped 
inadvertently popularize science for the non-wealthy so a person of average means 
reading could go "hey wait a minute, I have those things in this room. I could try that out right now".

We'll be focusing on two letters he wrote in January and February
of 1731 that were published in Philisophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, a scientific journal that started in 1665.  Back then there was a
variety of ways of getting published. In Stephens case, he just wrote
a letter, in prose to Cromwell Mortimer, the secretary of the journal, in freeform
discribing his experiments.

Mortimer would read over letters like this and if he thought "eh, cool -
doesn't look like nonsense" then it'd be typeset and published in the next issue... and that's all it took. 

In the 1700s, there wasn't a lot of social capital tied to being published in a
science journal. Outside of the small academic elite and a few scattered
societies nobody had any idea who even Isaac Newton was. He was actually president of
the Royal Society between 1703 and 1727 - there were only about 300 members at
the time. 

The publication push kinda came from the other direction, the journals
wanted to make sure they were able to dissiminate to their readership any new
scientific observations so they wanted to make sure they got a record of all
of them.

This meant a lot of the articles were basically "I brought a bunch of things into a room,
tried some experiments a few times, some weird things happened and then I
tried it again, and the wierd things happened again! In my excitement as I
continued observing the weirdness, I got ahead of myself and accidentally broke 
the stuff I was using to make the weird thing so I wasn't able to play with
it any more. Sincerely, some random dude. August 1st say 1721"

And that was often what science looked like.  Often there'd be followups a few
months later that were basically like

"omg you guys totally flipped out about my description of the weird things. I got a 
bunch of letters where you tried numerous variations and also saw the weird stuff going on.
Isn't this exciting? Anyway, here's my encore presentation where I talk about more weird stuff."

As I said there wasn't a lot of capital associated with science and Gray's
main profession was an artisan dyer of threads which was not a high paying job.  Along with bumming around as
a scientist he managed to be awarded the what will eventually be the coveted Copley Medal for scientific
inquiry twice, the first two years it was awarded. This award is given at most once
a year and the recipient list includes names like Stephen Hawking, Albert
Einstein, Pavlov, Louis Pasteur, Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, and Stephen Gray.

As there wasn't a lot of ways to make money with science at the time, it was
mostly a curious hobby sponsored by wealthy benefactors. The Copley medal for
instance, came about when someone, a landowner Sir Godfrey Copley, set aside
100 pounds or $15,000 in modern money to fund the medal and gift a small
bounty to be spent on science to the recipient. 

During the time of the experiments we're going to discuss Gray relied on the
benevolence of two people in particular whose names are going to come up, John
Godfrey, and Granville Wheler. John Godfrey spent quite a bit on science and
took many experimenters under his wings, essentially as an informal
foundation.

He even for instance, paid for the burial of John Harris, a clergyman who wrote Lexicon Technicum, the first
english encyclopedia with an emphasis on math and science. There's those words
again. The full name of the text is Lexicon Technicum, or, An Universal
English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art,
but the Arts Themselves. It covers law, commerce, music, heraldry, and
humanities but not theology, antiquity, history, or poetry. Write the first Math and
Science encyclopedia, have it be succesful among the very small group of
natural philosophers of the era and you'd still die so poor that someone else
is paying for your funeral.  So was the life of a scientist, I mean well,
documentarian maybe in London in the 1700s.

Stephen Gray, who lived at the London Charterhouse almshouse the last 15 years of his life, 
essentially a form of public housing for those too old to work and too poor to
rent, starts his letter apologizing for taking so long to write it:

"According to my promise I herein give an account of what farther I have
discovered relating to electrical attraction, which I should have done sooner,
but was willing to see what farther improvements I could make to those
Experiments"

Remember what I said about having a small fanclub? This is a letter to the
London science fanclub.

So Gray was at Godfrey's house in 1731 when he conducted experiments to show
that electricity could pass through two bodies and basically do the same thing
at the end of the second body that it could do at the beginning or without the
bodies there at all. 

Now we aren't talking the Isaac Newton style abstract body, no, Gray passed the
electricity through human bodies, children in fact.  This sounds insane, he
electrified people? 

Well yes, how else was he to show that the electricity passed through things and
wasn't say some invisible force like magnetism or did something even stranger?
If you apply some electricity at one end, have two people saying "ouch ouch" and 
then your little ball on a string sways towards a rod at the other, well then,
the electricty passes through.

It's a pretty brilliant experiment actually. 

But why did he use children? They don't weigh a lot.

He suspended them in the air using thin threads and did the experiment and
then had them stand on some rosin (an insulator) and do it again. One in the
air, one on the rosin, etc.

During his September 13 experiment Gray used this curious word when describing
the phenomena of electricity passing through children and then picking up
slips of paper:

"There was an attraction *communicated* from one end to the other"

This is of course projection from our modern eyeballs but it's worth noting
nonetheless.

So what kind of communication are we dealing with with electricity? 

Funny you ask that. The next day Wheler,
Godfrey and Gray were hanging out and they suspended a bunch of rods on
threads, electrifying them and seeing how they became attracted when
electrified and the electric effuvia, essentially meaning an unpleasant thing, 
moved through them as well. So wait, does electricity also travel through the air? Nobody
knew yet. Time for more experiments!

Gray called the children back, and on September 29 had some 
fishing rods with him. First he repeated the original experiment and found
that electricity passed through one rod, then an ouch, a second ouch, and the
other rod.  Not a huge surprise there.

Next he made the kids stand really close togther but not touch. He electrified
the rod but it stopped at the end of the first kid no matter how close they
got. Then when they touched it continued. 

So electricity travels. Apparently invisibly, quickly, and without much
effort. 

This caused quite a stir and some excitement. Gray was encouraged to do more
more more, tell us everything Mr. Gray.

Well ok then, so his next letter, the following month, was 27 pages long. It's
a fun read if you're into that kind of stuff and hint, I am into that kind of
stuff, but the part I'll focus on is when he went off to Godfrey's place,
remember, large land owner in the country.  He was trying to find out how far
electricity could travel so he was looking for balconies and rooftops to drop
a giant rod from, then have someone at the ground see if little sheets of
brass would do their thing or well let me just quote him:

"With the pole and tube I stood on the balcony, the assistant below in the
court, where he held the board with the leaf-brass on it; then the tube being
excited as usual, the electric virtue passed from the tube up the pole and
down the line to the ivory ball, which attracted the leaf brass ans as the
ball passed over it in its vibrations the leaf brass would follow it. But
these experiments are difficult to make in the open air, the least wind that
is stirring, carrying away the leaf brass"

He first went to a gallery that was 16 feet high, then from a parapet,
designed for war, about 29 feet high, then a clock tower at 34 feet ... and that was the
highest building in town.

He mentions wanting to try his experiments at St Pauls Cathedral in London not
doubting things would succeed.

Now let me stop you right there. Stephen. You know you aren't going to get
access to St Pauls cathedral and a 10 minute walk to your east was the
monument to the great fire of london, essentially a giant, publicly accessible
column 202 feet high that anyone could walk to the top of. 

Personally I don't think Stephen actually wanted to make a 200 foot rod and he was
like "ok, the clock tower is fine.  I'll just say I could do st pauls, nobody will take
me up on it. If I said I wanted to do the monument, I'm going to get some
knocks on my door the next day with royal society people saying "so stephen,
how about the monument? it's open today ... let's go!""

Also if he was worried about the wind pushing his rod from a first story
balcony, yeah, he didn't actually want to do it.

So after Gray ran out of tall buildings he tried to go further by laying his
rods horizontally. Unfortunately, the ways he supported them kept shorting out 
the connection because he had to keep the rod from breaking somehow.

But then Mr. Wheler suggested to maybe use fine silks to
hang things, a technique they had used back at Godfrey's house with the poles ... ladies and gentleman we are almost at the invention of the electric wire.

If you thought it would take less time then this, well that's not the kind of
party you're at.

What Wheler and Gray did next was form essentially a switchback network using
packthread and silkthread ... remember, Gray was a professional thread dyer
when he was younger, his knowledge of wire like things such as threads and
strings was actually quite good.  In a way he is the ideal candidate for
inventing wire, although he actually doesn't - a retired man with a 
lot of interest in electricity and a solid foundation of and access to pieces of long thin material. 

Throughout his description he, in multiple places uses the term "line of
communication" by which he meant the electric virtue, the static
electrification of the lengthy apparati that he constructed.  He used a glass
rod to rub whatever he was constructing. At the end of
the switchback network was an ivory ball which attracted bits of brass leaf. 

There's a nice diagram by the mathematician and cartographer Johann Doppelmayr
in a 1744 publication whose title is literally 99 words long and I had to go
to UCLA to view it in German on microfilm. Luckily the IEEE reproduced one of the diagrams
on page 467 of their March 2020 Proceedings of the IEEE. You can get that one
online for free and there's a link posted at comphistpod.com, did I tell you
there's a comphistpod.com? Anyway, yes, that's a thing now.

Back to our story. We're going to go over this mentioning the days so you can
get an idea as to how labor intensive this entire process must have been.

So it's July 2nd 1729, a very wet and cool july if historical records are
correct, about 10 am at otterden place - this is about 50 miles south east of
london, we're talking farmland even today. They start at about 10 am in a room
where they could make about 40 feet of packthread, essentially twine, before
having to cross back. 

so they go to the end of the room, have a piece of silk, think of it as a
horizontal bar, that they thread the twine around so they can go back the way
they came. It's not hard, they just looped it around, went to the end of the
room and then put the ivory ball and the brass sheets down.  When they did the
glass tube rubbing experiment at one end, it attracted the sheets at the
other almost instantly.  Success! Splendid!

How long could they make this? They tried another switchback being about 120
feet now (40 + 40 + 40 is ... oh yes there we are) and it worked.

And that's the end of the day. That took all day.

So we're at July 3rd and they went crazy ... essentially criss crossing back
and forth down the entire room, being about 293 feet ( about 7 times ) and it
worked, like almost as well as before.

And they were like "oh hey let's do it again" but then as they were rubbing
the twine with the glass tube it was too much and a chain reaction snapped the
silk lines one by one, completely collapsing all the work they had done. 

And so that sucked. But wait! He had brass wire to put there instead. So he
replaced the silk support by inadvertently grounding the whole experiment and
putting in solid brass. But then of course it didn't work. Drats! But they
figured it out and were like "dude, the silk worked fine. The brass is the
thing messing us all up here. That makes everything fail."

So they went back to the silk "bars" and vertically stacked them as a way of
reinforcement. They were then able to get up 666 feet stitching back and forth
and of course everything worked as well as before.

About 2 weeks later on July 11, they tried doing the experiment outside. They
put posts in the ground, suspending the silk from them, wrapped the packthread
around, going through gardens and fields, and got it all set up by about 7pm.
They got about 45 minutes of playing in until the london dew made things wet
and ruined everything.

So here we are, about 1729, with the concept of "communcation" going down a
"wire", in this case being a thread, in order to repeat an experiment at a
distance.  The CM extension to this, of simply labeling the sheets of paper
with different letters and having 26 of them or so, sounds like a pretty
obvious next step.  But we aren't going to get there yet. 

I promised I'd slow down and well here we are. We aren't even at sparks yet.
So next time we'll be looking at more wire technology and work on up to our
Scots magazine publication. Then we'll skip over the stuff in 1.1 and go right
into communicating with pith balls. It'll be glorious.

Also let's talk about the show itself. These episodes take a lot of effort,
finding all the sources, hundreds of pages of reading, it's a bit of time.
Once a week appears too ambitious so for now it's going to be twice a month. I
may put out some small discussion episodes like I did last week in between but
the history episodes for now, twice a month which means we'll pick up the
story sometime around July 4th, 2020.

PPS, thanks for putting up with the various audio qualities. I'm still
learning the black magic of podcasting microphones. Hopefully things are
starting to get better.
