Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.3, the journey to the
electric wire.

Day sa goo lee ae

As discussed in the last episode I am already caving into listener requests
and so let's step into our wayback machine, turning the clock back about 50
years to the late 1720s. This is before our CM article in Scots magazine in
1752 where there were floating alphabetic rips of paper statically clinging to
balls. 

We're going to start with electric communication. Well at least someone who
talked about electricity itself as a form of communication.  The early
scientist we're going to be talking about is Stephen Gray. Sorry, the supposedly working telegraph 
promise given at the end of 1.1 will have to wait for a future episode.

When I call Stephen Grey an early scientist, I do mean it. The word scientist was first used in
1834 by the english polymath William Hewl. Our modern cognitive perimeters we
place around phrases such as math and science are pretty contemporary. In the
1700s people considered many more things, such as commerce and music to fall
under the umbrella labeled science. That's because science as an institution
and a discipline was still forming at the time. Stephen
Gray however, really sounds like someone who would fit strongly inside even our
more restricted modern notions of science


In A History of Science, published in 1904, Henry Williams referred to him as an irascible old
pensioner. Over on Wikipedia you'll read that he was a relatively unknown 
shadow of his friend John Theophilus Desaguliers who stole the limelight 
over factional differences between Flamsteed and Newton - Newton, did you know
he was an actual irascible scoundrel? A great scientist but also kind of an
bellicose intellectual pirate. We'll be going over his colorful spats in the
first supplemental, hopefully next week. Newton died a childless bachelor. Was
that because he was secretly what we classify today as asexual or homosexual? 
Or was it because he was just that insufferable to be around? T
We'll be going more into the great Flamsteed/Newton Newton/Liebniz
Sloane/Newton drama next week where we'll get into soap opera details on all
these character but I'm saving that fun for next week.

Anyway back to Grey. If you read Desaguliers "A Dissertation Concerning Electricity", from 
1742, a list of 24 different experiments to observe the phenomena of electricity, the
author speaks quite glowingly of Stephen Gray who by then had been dead for 6
years. Gray even probably lived with Desagulier for about 4 years in the 1710s. In his 
later letters in the 1720s he speaks of corresponding with Desagulier regularly.  
To get an insight into Grey, all you need to do is read his publications. He's
energetic and excitable about experimentation and the sees science as a form
of play. He doesn't seems to be interested in anything other than the pursuit.

I like to think of Gray as an excited science nerd without social graces. The
impertinant Doc Brown personality from Back to the Future in 18th century London. 

Gray died a childless bachelor at the age of 70 spending at least 30 years 
publishing early science works spanning from astronomy, optics, and most 
importantly electricity.  Well there was a large 25 year gap where his papers 
got rejected but we can baically point the finger at Newton being a jerk.
Anyway, after Isaac died, Grey's submissions magically became accepted once
more for publication and most of his exciting electrical work came after he was 60.

He was never a rich man and had a life of hard labor. After being elected to
the royal society, the place to go for science in the day, he had to have
someone else cover his dues - well as it turned out actually a lot of people
didn't pay and the society was pretty financially insolvent for the first half
of the 1700s, but what are you expecting from a nerd club?

I like to think for Grey as one of those really smart people you may know who has
a dusty PHD he got solely based on curiosity tucked away in a box he doesn't
ever mention, who drives around in a beat up old car and is always working on
interesting projects, not really seeming to care much about money or status. 
A person who keeps the company of respected people and is well-respected by 
them, but to everyone else, is just some scraggly wanderer completely 
captured by his hobbies.  It actually sounds pretty fun.

Gray's impoverishment may have actually worked in his favor because being on a
small budget, his science experiments ended up often being wickedly clever, using
pretty common things and thus being easily repeatable. He may have helped 
inadvertently popularize science for the non-wealthy so a person of average means 
reading could go "hey wait a minute, I have those things in this room. I could try that out right now".
His first publications were about microscopes made with water-droplets in
1697. 

Anyway, we'll be focusing on two letters he wrote in January and February
of 1731 that were published in Philisophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, a scientific journal that started in 1665.  Back then there was a
variety of ways of getting published. In Stephens case, he just wrote
a letter, in prose, at the time to Cromwell Mortimer, the secretary of the journal, in freeform
discribing his experiments.

Mortimer would read over letters like this and if he thought "eh, cool -
doesn't look like nonsense" then it'd be typeset and published in the next
issue... and that's all it took, well at least after Newton died. Gray's first
electrical article in 1708 was rejected by the secretary at the time, Sloane. 

In the 1700s, there wasn't a lot of social capital tied to being published in a
science journal. Outside of the small academic elite and a few scattered
societies nobody had any idea who even Isaac Newton was. When he was president of
the Royal Society between 1703 and 1727 - there were only about 300 elected
members.

The publication push often came from the other direction, the journals
wanted to make sure they were able to dissiminate to their readership any new
scientific observations, well the ones from people they liked, so they wanted 
to make sure they got a record of all of them. 

This meant a lot of the articles were basically "I brought a bunch of things into a room,
tried some experiments a few times, some weird things happened and then I
tried it again, and the wierd things happened again! In my excitement as I
continued observing the weirdness, I got ahead of myself and accidentally broke 
the stuff I was using to make the weird thing so I wasn't able to play with
it any more. Sincerely, some random dude. August 1st say 1721"

And that was often what science looked like.  Often there'd be followups a few
months later that were basically like

"omg you guys totally flipped out about my description of the weird things. I got a 
bunch of letters where you tried numerous variations and also saw the weird stuff going on.
Isn't this exciting? Anyway, here's my encore presentation where I talk about more weird stuff."

As I said there wasn't a lot of capital associated with science and Gray's
main profession was probably an artisan dyer of threads in Canterbury which was not a high paying job.  Along with bumming around as
a scientist he managed to be awarded the what will eventually be the coveted Copley Medal for scientific
inquiry twice, the first two years it was awarded. This award is given at most once
a year and the recipient list includes names like Stephen Hawking, Albert
Einstein, Pavlov, Louis Pasteur, Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, and Stephen Gray.

As there wasn't a lot of ways to make money with science at the time, it was
mostly a curious hobby sponsored by wealthy benefactors. The Copley medal for
instance, came about when someone, a landowner Sir Godfrey Copley, set aside
100 pounds or $15,000 in modern money to fund the medal and gift a small
bounty to be spent on science to the recipient. 

During the time of the experiments we're going to discuss Gray relied on the
benevolence of two people in particular whose names are going to come up, John
Godfrey, and Granville Wheler. John Godfrey spent quite a bit on science and
took many experimenters under his wings, essentially as an informal
foundation.

He even for instance, paid for the burial of John Harris, a clergyman who wrote Lexicon Technicum, the first
english encyclopedia with an emphasis on math and science. There's those words
again. The full name of the text is Lexicon Technicum, or, An Universal
English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art,
but the Arts Themselves. It covers law, commerce, music, heraldry, and
humanities but not theology, antiquity, history, or poetry. Write the first Math and
Science encyclopedia, have it be succesful among the very small group of
natural philosophers of the era and you'd still die so poor that someone else
is paying for your funeral.  So was the life of a scientist, I mean well,
documentarian maybe in London in the 1700s.

Stephen Gray, who lived at the London Charterhouse almshouse the last 15 years
of his life, essentially a form of public housing for those too old to work and too poor to
rent (and it took him years to get in), starts his letter apologizing for taking so long to write it:

"According to my promise I herein give an account of what farther I have
discovered relating to electrical attraction, which I should have done sooner,
but was willing to see what farther improvements I could make to those
Experiments"

Remember what I said about having a small fanclub? This is a letter to his
London science fanclub.

So Gray was at Godfrey's house in 1731 when he conducted experiments to show
that electricity could pass through a body and basically do the same thing
at the end of the body that it could do at the beginning.

Now we aren't talking the jerk Newton's abstract body, no, Gray passed the
electricity through human bodies, children in fact.  This sounds insane, he
electrified people? 

Well yes and no. We're talking a very small amount of electricity here. For
instance, as one of the boys standed on rosin, essentially an insulator, his
hands were extended a few inches above leaf brass. Then Grey used a glass tube
to rub the boy near the ankle, there was a reaction near the boy's hands with
the leaf brass. So yes, he was electricuting children, but in a Mr. Wizard
kind of way.

He used children because along with having them stand on rosin he suspended
them by very thin threads to repeat the experiment, really trying to
understand if there was a difference between suspension and being grounded.

And also although being a very small amount of electricity it could still be
sensed. At the time they used the word effluvia, essentially an unpleasant
feeling to talk about electricity.

Additionally a human can do thing like grab things which makes running
multiple experiments pretty fast.

Since Grey had a foot base to stand on with the rosin, and a contraption with
thin thread to hang someone he did a number of experiments with two children,
one hanging and one standing. 

The standing one would hold his hand out above the brass leaf as before, but
his other hand would be clapsed to the boy suspended by the threads as grey
would take his glass and rub the ankle of the suspended boy to see if the
electric Virtue would "communicate" through the boys.  This of course worked.

This being established he could then see fairly quickly what things
electricity passed through. The boys could hold either end of some twine, or a
ruler, or some brass, or whatever he wished. Grey would use his glass tube to
rub the ankle of the suspended one and then see if the brass leaves rose at
the other end of the chain. If they did, then the electric virtue passed
through the material.

It's all pretty efficient. Now if you noticed I used the word "communicate"
here which is again, the actual topic of all of this. We're trying to
establish that electric communication is possible and here we've established
that the electricity itself appears to communicate.


The next day Wheler, Godfrey and Gray were hanging out and they suspended a 24
foot rod by silk and had two right angle wands above it but not touching it.
When he rubbed the rod he found a piece of thread was attracted to the wands,
even though the wand had never touched the rod but was only approximately near
it. This made it look like the electric virtue was also wireless,
communicating through the air between a wand and the rod. Is this possible? Nobody
knew yet. Time for more experiments!

---
Gray called the children back, and on September 29 had some 
fishing rods with him. He had both boys stand on the rosin and hold a twine
between each other. He rubbed the twine with the glass and both boys were able
to attract and repel the brass leaves ... this is basically calibration. Now
having established that he had the kids stand really close togther but not to
let their couch touch, about an inch away. This is similar to the rod and the
wand but with humans. He then tried to repeat the experiment but the electric
virtue didn't jump through the air from one boy to the other. 

He asked the boys to toch each others hands and it immediately traversed. 

Stephen Grey continues on for another couple pages with other experiments that
are outside the pure scope of our wire study but these articles apparently
caused quite a stir and excitement.

There was a flurry of electrical publicatons that followed soon which meant
Grey had inspired many to do this pursuit. He himself was clearly encouraged
to write some more as if the royal society said, "more more, tell us
everything Mr. Gray."

Well ok then, so his next letter, the following month, was 27 pages long. It's
a fun read if you're into that kind of stuff and hint, I am into that kind of
stuff, the part I'll focus on is when he first went off to Godfrey's place and
then followed it up with Wheler, the large land owner.  He was trying to find out how far
electricity could travel. 

He started with making longer and longer poles but by the time he got to 32
feet it became difficult because the pole started bending and when he was
rubbing it with the glass he was whipping the end which if you recall has to
be fairly close to extremely light flakes of brass.

So it's time for another contraption.

Imagine a giant fishing pole 18 feet long with the fishing line tied at the end, 34 feet long,
and then at the very bottom is the ball of cork or an ivory ball. There's an
assistant in the courtyard holding essentially a board of wood with some of
the brass leaves on it so when Grey manages to drop the ball the assistant
walks over and makes sure the leaves are close enough to the ball to get
attracted to it if the electricity is transferred. This is his next
contraption.

Now Grey from the balcony needs to rub the pole with the glass tube and see if the electric
virtue is communicated to the end of the twine. At the same time the assistant
has to wander around the courtyard and make sure he can keep up with the
vibrating cork that is moving to and fro.  But it gets even wackier as Grey
says:

"But these experiments are difficult to make in the open air, the least wind that
is stirring, carrying away the leaf brass"

Oh right, wind.

Since this balcony was the highest thing he had access to he tried to lengthen
things by making things strictly horiztonal. However, he tried fixing his
pole to beams via loops and nails. This of course isn't going to work. 

So he gave up the horizontal method for now but thought he'd try it at
St Pauls Cathedral in London not doubting things would succeed.

Now let me stop you right there. Stephen. You know you aren't going to get
access to St Pauls cathedral and a 10 minute walk to your east was the
monument to the great fire of london, essentially a giant, publicly accessible
column 202 feet high that anyone could walk to the top of. 

Personally I don't think Stephen actually wanted to make a 200 foot rod and he was
like "ok, the clock tower is fine.  I'll just say I could do st pauls, nobody will take
me up on it. If I said I wanted to do the monument, I'm going to get some
knocks on my door the next day with royal society people saying "so stephen,
how about the monument? it's open today ... let's go!""

If you've ever been to this tower imagine someone with a giant fishing rod and
a twine extending down 200 feet to the ground with some ball of cork on the
end as an assistant runs around the courtyard. It's kind of a pity this didn't
happen. I mean it could ... we could probably get together and do this, rent
some renaissance clothes... Who do we need to talk to? Maybe the royal society
would be down, "Yo, this half sentence buried in this article you published
289 years ago, you guys still down to do this? Let's go!"

Anyway, back to Grey. In lat June he went to Weler's place who really lives in
the middle of nowhere, about 7 miles southwest of feversham, which is again, 9
miles outside of canterbury.  Even today, really small town.

He went to a gallery that was 16 feet high, then from a parapet,
designed for war, about 29 feet high, then a clock tower at 34 feet ... and that was the
highest building in town.

Wheler then suggested "hey lets do this horizontally" but Stephen was like
"yo, I tried that at Godfreys in may, really didn't work". But then Wheler was
like "wait, remember those poles and wand we suspended by silk?" and Grey was
like "oh yeah those worked".

So Wheler got his servants to work on some very thin silks to hold the
packthread so the signal will traverse from one end to the other ... that
means, ladies and gentleman we are almost at the invention of the electric wire.

If you thought it would take less time then this, well that's not the kind of
party you're at.

What Wheler and Gray did next was form essentially a switchback network using
packthread and silkthread ... remember, Gray was a professional thread dyer
when he was younger, his knowledge of wire like things such as threads and
strings was actually quite good.  In a way he is the ideal candidate for
inventing wire, although he actually doesn't - a retired man with a 
lot of interest in electricity and a solid foundation of and access to pieces of long thin material. 

Throughout his description he, in multiple places uses the term "line of
communication" by which he meant the electric virtue, the static
electrification of the lengthy apparati that he constructed.  He used a glass
rod to rub whatever he was constructing. At the end of
the switchback network was an ivory ball which attracted bits of brass leaf. 

There's a nice diagram by the mathematician and cartographer Johann Doppelmayr
in a 1744 publication whose title is literally 99 words long and has yet to be
digitized or translated from German. However, the IEEE reproduced one of the diagrams
on page 467 of their March 2020 Proceedings of the IEEE. You can get that one
online for free and there's a link posted at the podcast's website at comphistpod.com, did I tell you
there's a comphistpod.com? Anyway, yes, that's a thing now.

Back to our story. We're going to go over this mentioning the days so you can
get an idea as to how labor intensive this entire process must have been.

So it's July 2nd 1729, a very wet and cool july if historical records are
correct, about 10 am at otterden place - this is about 50 miles south east of
london, we're talking farmland even today. They start at about 10 am in a room
where they could make about 40 feet of packthread, essentially twine, before
having to cross back. 

so they go to the end of the room, have a piece of silk, think of it as a
horizontal bar, that they thread the twine around so they can go back the way
they came. It's not hard, they just looped it around, went to the end of the
room and then put the ivory ball and the brass sheets down.  When they did the
glass tube rubbing experiment at one end, it attracted the sheets at the
other almost instantly.  Success! Splendid!

How long could they make this? They tried another switchback being about 120
feet now (40 + 40 + 40 is ... oh yes there we are) and it worked.

And that's the end of the day. That took all day.

So we're at July 3rd and they went crazy ... essentially criss crossing back
and forth down the entire room, being about 293 feet ( about 7 times ) and it
worked, like almost as well as before.

And they were like "oh hey let's do it again" but then as they were rubbing
the twine with the glass tube it was too much and a chain reaction snapped the
silk lines one by one, completely collapsing all the work they had done. 

And so that sucked. But wait! He had brass wire to put there instead. So he
replaced the silk support by inadvertently grounding the whole experiment and
putting in solid brass. But then of course it didn't work. Drats! But they
figured it out and were like "dude, the silk worked fine. The brass is the
thing messing us all up here. That makes everything fail."

So they went back to the silk "bars" and vertically stacked them as a way of
reinforcement. They were then able to get up 666 feet stitching back and forth
and of course everything worked as well as before.

About 2 weeks later on July 11, they tried doing the experiment outside. They
put posts in the ground, suspending the silk from them, wrapped the packthread
around, going through gardens and fields, and got it all set up by about 7pm.
They got about 45 minutes of playing in until the london dew made things wet
and ruined everything.

So here we are, about 1729, with the concept of "communcation" going down a
"wire", in this case being a thread, in order to repeat an experiment at a
distance.  The CM extension to this, of simply labeling the sheets of paper
with different letters and having 26 of them or so, sounds like a pretty
obvious next step.  But we aren't going to get there yet. 

I promised I'd slow down and well here we are. We aren't even at sparks yet.
So next time we'll be looking at more wire technology and work on up to our
Scots magazine publication. Then we'll skip over the stuff in 1.1 and go right
into communicating with pith balls. It'll be glorious.

Also let's talk about the show itself. These episodes take a lot of effort,
finding all the sources, hundreds of pages of reading, it's a bit of time.
Once a week appears too ambitious so for now, the longer, pure history timeline
episodes will be twice a month. In between will be mini-episodes that talk
about things adjacent to our story. This means next week we'll be going over
the drama queen Isaac Newton and the week after that we'll be picking up the
next episode on our way to the electric wire.

Also thanks for putting up with the various audio qualities. I'm still
learning the black magic of podcasting microphones. Hopefully things are
starting to get better.
