The prehistory of electric telegraphy begins with the “sympathetic needle.” The most widely known version of this
myth was published by Italian Jesuit scholar Famiano
Strada in 1617 [23], and it continued to attract believers
for some time. Excerpt from a version published in 1793,
my translation from French, abridged [24]:
Wonderful secrets for using the Sympathetic
Compass to write to a distant friend, so that he
will receive the message while it is written. Make
two identical compasses with the letters of the
alphabet inscribed around the edge of the dial.
Give one of the compasses to a friend with whom
you want to communicate. When your friend,
now at a distant location, turns the needle of his
compass to a letter, the needle of your compass
will turn by itself to the same letter. When you
answer, do as your friend did.
