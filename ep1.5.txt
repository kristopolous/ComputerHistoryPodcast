Immortal Halley! thy unwearied soul 
On Wisdom's pinion flew from pole to pole, 
The uncertain compass to its task restored, 
Each ocean fathom’d, and each wind explored, 
Commanded trade with every breeze to fly, 
And gave to Britain half the Zemblian sky. 
And see, he comes, distinguish’d, loved, caress'd, 
Mark'd by each eye, and hugg'd to every breast; 
His godlike labours wit and science fire, 
All factions court him, and all sects admire; 
While Britain, with a gratitude unknown 
To every age but Nero's and our own, 
A gratitude that will for ever shame 
The Spartan glory, and the’ Athenian name
Tell it, ye winds! that all the world may hear-
Bless'd his old age with-ninety pounds a year.
Are these our triumphs? these the sums we give
to ripen genius, and to bid it live?
Can britian in her fits of mandness pour
One half her Indies on a Roman whore,
And still permit the weeping Muse to tell
how poor neglected Desaguliers fell?
How he, who taught two gracious kings to view
All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew,
Died in a cell, without a friend to save,
Without a guinea, and without a grave?

James Cawthorn, The Vanity Of Human Enjoyment, 1749.

18th century England threw so little cash toward science that even the poets were writing about it.

<intro>

Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.5, the journey to the electric wire part deux.

In 1.3 we went over two, and now I'm showing my cards, carefully cherry picked publications by Stephen Gray; the first one involving children suspended by what he called hairlines and the second being a long line of thread being switchbacked to show that electricity follows the line all the way to its end.

We also talked about how Gray's experiments were really easy to reproduce, unlike say, Francis Hauksbee's air pump, a device to create a small ball without any air in it to run vacuum measurements. The air pump was pretty useful but apparently quite costly to make. Many early scientists talked about having to borrow other people's pumps and how some of them kinda didn't work very well. Not with Gray though. Suspending someone with some thread? Totally doable. A long line of thread suspended by silk? Yes, that too.

So what happened?

That's right, people did it. Let's talk about one of them in particular, a chemist and superintendent of the royal garden who died of smallpox at the age of 40. Now if you think that sounded very French, you'd be right. The Parisian Charles François de Cisternay du Fay, inspired by the two experiments of Mr. Gray we spoke of last time, repeated them in Paris.

Many of his findings were reported in the French Academy of Sciences, which got completely dismantled in the French Revolution and replaced with something effectively the same about 2 years later, because, the french revolution. But that's still 50 years in the future.

If french is your thing you can read his 30 page article in Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences published in 1733. There's a link in the show notes.

And if French isn't your thing, Du Fay happened to have been kind enough to have written essentially the same findings in an english document in Philosophical Transactions.

The first replicated experiment we're going to talk about I didn't go over last time but when I read what Du Fay had to say about it I just couldn't leave it out.
Gray had run a number of experiments which really made it look like color had something to do with how something responded to electricity. For instance, Gray had suspended his boys by different color silks and then mesured how long they were able to "communicate the electric fire". He found a repeatable pattern of duration for the different colors.

Du Fay, fascinated by this finding, decided to try to simplify it as much as possible. He took 9 identical silk ribbons of different colors and then had a single glass tube that he brought near each of them at the same exact time, at the same exact distance. He noticed that the black one reacted first, every time. He rearranged the order of the ribbons and it was the same. After the black came the white and then an order of colors that always repeated itself. The color pattern roughly matched what Gray had found in his experiments.

Next Du Fay took pieces of colored cotton gauze and gold leaf and moved the gause pieces near the gold leaf and saw a different, but utterly repeatable pattern. This does sound like great evidence.

However, we all know, I think all of us do at least, that the color of something doesn't affect its electric properties. But how can we show that?  If you'd like to think this through, press pause and come back and see if you can think of Du Fay's next experiment.

Alright, I hope you had a fun time thinking that through. Du Fay used a prism. He threw various colors of the prism on different pieces of white gause, and there was no difference in attraction. He also warmed and wetted the gauses and silks and then saw the color differences go away. So he concludes "this difference proceeds not from the color but from the substances that are employed in the dying". Brilliant. He then used different methods of coloring, charcoal, carmine, and showed that it was a property of the chemicals of the dye, not of the colors.

So Gray made a correct, repeatable observation, but drew from it the wrong conclusion. This is great science. I'm excited, are you? Good, me too!

But wait, we're only 1/3 through Du Fay's paper.  Next he does Gray's packthread line experiment but Du Fay has the idea that by wetting the thread he could get a better connection. Then using glass tubes instead of silk for better support, Du Fay makes 8 returns through a garden. He achieves 1256 feet in high winds even, which is around twice what Gray did. Now Du Fay doesn't actually mention *which* garden he was using but he did say, 8 returns, crossed over 2 sidewalks, 1256 feet. So I looked up old maps of the royal garden and yes, there was an obvious long clearing about 160 feet wide crossing over 2 sidewalks so he probably did it at his office. It's cool Du Fay, I'm not going to run off and tell King Louis XIII, don't worry. Investigative reporting on a mostly irrelevant 287 year old science experiment, you must be tuning into the Computing History podcast. 

By the way, the old map I'm using is called the Turgot Map of Paris, which wasn't made by Turgot, he's just the dude who paid for it. Louis Bretez, the actual guy took two years between 1734 and 1736 to make this map. He produced a 20 secdion map that when assembled is 8 by 10 feet. You can find it online but it's about gigapixel and a gigabyte, which means you need to know what you're doing to browse it.  I made an easily zoomable and pannable version of the map. The link for you to view this fantastic isometric map of 1730s is at comphistpod.com. It's also annotated with the places mentioned in this episode.

Moving on, Du Fay also suspended a child and repeated Gray's experiments. But then he took it a step further and suspended himself by the silk lines as well. And I'm going to quote the next part because it's important:

"while I am suspended on the lines, if the electric tube be put near one of my hands, or my legs, and then if another person approches me, [podcasters note, that other person he's referring to is Abbe Nollet who will be important later] ... anyway, another person approaches me and passes his hand within an inch of my face, legs, hand or cloathes, there immediately issues from my body one or more pricking shoots, with a crackling noise, that causes that person as well as my self, a little pain. Pain resembling that from the sudden prick of a pin, or the burning from a Spark of Fire...And in the dark, these snappings are, as may be easily imagined, so many sparks of fire" 

We have electric spark. Now this isn't the first time electric spark had been observed. We had Robert Boyle's glow in the dark diamond in 1663 and Otto Guericke's sulfur globe in 1672, Dr. William Wall rubbing sulfur and amber in 1708 and saying it looks like lightning (good job!), ... either way it's always nice to see another spark.

Du Fay next talks about two distinct electricities, very different from one another. The first he called vitreous, which means "glass-like" and the other one "resinous". He then notes that vitreous electrics, such as glass, rock-crystal and wool repel other vitreous electrics while resinous, such as amber, silk, and paper, repels other resinous. And that vitreous and resinous attract each other. Two electrified silks will repel, two woolen threads will repel, but a silk and a wool, those attract. 

There's even more but really, we just collected everything we came for so we must move on.

We now return to London to visit our old friend Dr. Desaguliers. It's around about 1736 or so and Stephen Gray has passed on. Desaguliers was a great scientist sure, but as we'll be seeing, this is one of the first real ages of the celebrity scientist, like say Neil deGrasse Tyson or Carl Sagan.  These scientists are more importantly evangelists of science who spread the findings and the practice.

Desaguliers main contribution is his division of objects into electrics and non-electrics, what we today call insulators and conductors. I know that sounded backwards but it's correct. He also started working on the second English language book concerning electricity, which I briefly mentioned in 1.3 - the first being by Boyle in 1675. Without the popularizers like Desaguliers we wouldn't have gotten things like the Scots Magazine article about 15 years later.

These interesting experiments continued to be documented and spread and by the late 1730s, the Germans are getting in on the action. Now for all the history nerds out there, yes, there technically is no Germany yet. And for the rest of you, Germany in the 1700s is a complete mess, you have the holy roman empire, saxony, bavaria, the austrian netherlands, hanover, brandenburg, and oh yeah, the hungarians had a good chunk of things as well ... Instead of trying to get any of this correct, when we talk about the scientists of central europe we're going to use whatever nationality english texts of the time referred to them as. I think that's fair. Same things go with the Italians, which is even messier. In fact, the two little enclaves of San Marino and Vatican City still haven't hopped on the Italian unification train.

The Germans, as a whole, occupied themselves with trying to get a more fervent and strong electric spark. As an aside, I know I just made a sweeping generalization. The generalization was made in Bakewell's 1853 text, Mottelay 1922, Priestley 1769, maybe it's not how we'd treat it in the 21st century but let's go with it for now. Germans equals giant sparks. Besides, I'm setting you up for something here that's necessary to get to very long wires by the end of this recording.

So the first German is Boze outside of Hamburg in the north who invented the first "prime conductor", essentially a mechanism for accumulating and temporarily storing charge. Don't worry if you've never heard that term before, it essentially exited the english language as an electrical term by about 1920. Boze used globes and cylinders to accumulate the charge, the history of which we could go into with Otto Von Guericke and Hauksbee, but let's just say there is a mechanical process, a utilization of the electric and non-electric combintains, and a way to accumulate charge. Alright, Mr Winkler of Liepzig came up with another machine for the automated rubbing of the tubes we've been talking about and the globes, which we just talked about. His machine spun the globe at 180 rpm.

The british followed in suit. They weren't satisfied with just one of these machines at a time though. Abbe Nollet, yeah there he is, worked with someone nemed Dr. Watson, who will be kinda important to our story proceeded to shock themselves so much that they bled. They noticed how the blood when electrified would ... they even kill small birds ... one of them even used a 250 yard iron line and knocked small animals off of it for fu ... you know, we don't need to go into this. Let's see 250 yards is about 750 feet ... ok, that's Gray's distance, yeah, not needed.

Well actually is is, or at least it will be. You see, this sounds like it's getting out of hand, people shocking themselves in a way that would knock them on their feet, machines with foot pedals and cranks that would accumulate charge which sounds pretty dangerous but I promise, this is pocket change in comparison to what's coming next.

And because suspense supposedly makes a good story, let's just make you wait until next time as mosey through other things the Germans did. Remember in 1.1 how we mentioned CM's bells where every letter was a different tone and the bells would be playing instead of words? Well the germans at this time are the ones who came up with that. The design really hasn't changed much ... you've seen them ... that circular saucer shaped thing with the small metal arm that has a ball at the end that whacks it  going "ding ding ding ding". That's 1700s tech.

Another thing we get during this time is essentially a user-friendly version of the flying boy experiment. Hausen from Leipzig constructed a number of machines described by Watson used throughout Amsterdam and an small city called Leyden, where you'd have someone hanging by threads, another person on the rosin, then they would touch the spinning globe to build up the charge ... rinse wash and repeat stephen grey. I can imagine this at an 18th century carnival where two people go up, pay a small fee, get a couple shocks, light some things on fire with their fingers ... oh wait, that actually kinda happened and happens to be the entire topic of the next episode along with the thing I'm cautiously saving.

Ok so skipping over next time's fun parts we're going to be like an old movie where they just did a cutaway and kinda explained things later. Bam, we have a leyden jar. This device was essentially the first capacitor. It could hold charge, a lot of charge. And it could be transported around.

This means you could use your german accumulation machine built around a "prime conductor" to charge your magical leyden jar and then as long as you didn't break one simple rule you could relatively safely discharge electricity wherever you pleased.  This was a great tool for experimentation.

So by 1746, you had a number of interesting findings already. On Nov 12, 1746 Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier spoke at the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris concerning his latest findings. These were then transcribed in December in English to Philosophical Transactions. This first notable thing is he describes a wire about 2000 french toises, that is to say a paris league, or near two english miles and a half, and that's a quote, with some of it dragged on wet grass and ground newly ploughed up. But he still got a connection, so yeah, electricity over 2 miles.

Le Monnier also did an experiment over what he called the Bason of the Thuilleries which is a giant fountain, well more of a reflection pond, that still exists in the Tuileries garden, this is in the super touristy part of Paris, near arc de triomphe so you may even have a photo of this thing if being a tourist in Paris is something you've done. 

So the diameter of this pond is about as wide as a jumbo jet wingspan, about 205 feet, just so we know what we're dealing with. We go to Le Monnier, "there was stretched around half the circumference of the bason, an iron chain, which was entirely out of the water". There's two people standing across from each other, pond in between. They are holding the chain. One of them has his hand in the water and the other one has one of these oh so dangerous leyden jars and what's he doing here? he has a yes, iron rod fixed to some cork which is floating on top of the pond. Now if he touches the leyden jar upon the iron rod, and no shock happens, that means the water is not closing the circuit. If he touches the rod with the leyden jar and they both receive a shock, then the electricity goes over the wire. Let's see what happens. Both men get violently shocked. Success.

Anyway, this is probably another something we could try to recreate, like the fishing pole from the monument to great fire of london I suggested in 1.3, on second thought, let's not.

And finally on trying to determine the speed of electricity, Le Monnier used a mile of wire and himself to complete the circuit. After repeatedly shocking himself, he concluded electricity moved far too fast for him to measure, "at least 30 times the speed of sound".

Back in London, Watson does a series of several meetings in 1747 resulting in a 72 page article. Our journey to the electric wire is almost complete.
I'm going to leave out some of his wordiness and quote Watons as follow:

"This Circuit is always described in the shortest manner possible; but if the components conduct differently, this circuit is always formed through the best conductor, however great its length is"
Moving on...
"Metals conduct best the electrical powers. Water likewise is an admirable Conductor; for the electrical power makes no difference between solids and fluids as such but only as they are non-electric matter"

So let's go to 1748 where Watson set about trying to find the speed of electricity. He did this experiment at a place called Shooter's Hill, supposedly named because it was a strategic place for archers to be in the middle ages. London is pretty flat and Shooter's Hill is one of the highest points there, at 433 feet. For comparison if you've ever been at about 40 stories and looked out the window, that's about the viewing distance we're talking about - so it's not terrible. 

So here he is with 12 other people including two people from the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin. The experiment is to make a 2 mile electric circuit, the longest we've seen up to this point. At the midpoint they'd have an observer detect how long it would take for the electricity to arrive after it was applied at the other end.

How would he detect it? Well this is the 1740s so he'd hold the wires of course, one in each hand, and the the observer would be the thing completing the circuit. Then people would be watching for him to convulse in shock by being electrocuted and see if there's a noticable delay between the two events. Yes, this is what we are doing. Over a dozen people most of which who have PhDs including the countries leading astronomer, the president of the royal society ... here's what we're doing today. Alright.

So they set about setting up iron the experiment using silk suspended from wooden stakes and switchbacks of exposed iron wire criss-crossing back and forth down a field about 2 city blocks long (Watson claims 726 feet).

So it took them all day and by nightfall they made sure that the wire wasn't touching the wood because the dew would lead to moisture and, I quote "the electrictrical circuit might be shortened" or what we would call "a short circuit".

Anyway, the next morning they now had a Leyden jar, or what they called a "Leyden phial" at the time, zig zagging wires traversing down a field and a small space for a brave volunteer to go over and hold the two ends.  Watson refers to these people as just "men" which makes me think that none of his entourage was willing to take the hit for science. Anway let's quote Watson:
"When all parts of the apparatus were properly disposed, several explosions of the charged phial were made; and it was invariably seen (podcasters note, this means they did it a bunch of times), that the Observer holding in each Hand one of the extremeties of these wires was confulsed in both his arms in the instant of making the Explosions!"

He did another variations where he had 4 men, holding hands, and two on either end holding the wire just to make sure there's not like some kind of human variation in this. Watson excitedly writes: "They were all seen convulsed in the instant of the explosion. Every one who felt it complained of the severity of the shock". 

What an 18th century way to refer to people screaming expletives. This experiment was repeated by Winckler in Leipzig, Lemonnier in Paris and in 1795 by someone who will play a role later, Betancourt, who did a 26 mile variation during a 2 year stint in London

---

And next we're going to go over why this podcast is 5 days late. This is me breaking the 4th wall. Let's go to "Bibliographical History Of Electricity And Magnetism" from 1922 by Paul Mottelay, midway through page 175, and I quote:

"Watson, in 1745, proves that the electric fluid takes the shortest course, passing through the substance of the best medium of connection and not along its surface.  This, he demonstrated by discharging a phial through a wire covered with a mixture of wax and resin."

And there it is. That looks like our first insulated wire. But here's the problem. He lists literally 50 references for that section. I read through all of them. That was on Saturday. The description of a wire with wax and resin in 1745 is in none of them. I checked twice, that was Sunday. On Monday I looked for where he could have got this idea. I started searching essentially small phrases of the paragraph to see if the words came up elsewhere. I found out that Mottelay kinda plagerized a sentence from the 1841 Encyclopedia Britanica. I continued searching and then I found an error in Mottley's citations! I believe he erroneously cited "Experiments and Observations on Electricity" when what he mant to cite was "Experiments and Observations Tending to Illustrate the Nature and Properties of Electricity" - these are two different books. I have been unable to find an original document describing the idea of an insulated wire.

I'm going to say something really bold here: Mottelay made this up. "Now just because you can't find it" you finger wag at me but look, the leyden jar itself was insulated with wax and other materials, the prime conductor was also insulated. It's not like they didn't know how to do this. In 1737 there's a paper describing a rod of iron with sealing wax as a supporter and the electricity passing through it.
In "The Philosophical Transactions" abridgement for 1743 to 1750, edited by John Martin, there's this description on page 276:

"a small glass, tube is fixed, thro' which an iron wire,  reaches to the middle of the glass
vessel, an exceeding small space being between the vessel and the wire.
The tube and the wire are so strongly cemented with sealing-wax, that
no air can penetrate."

There was no real use-case of stable wire that needed to stick arond for months or years, there was no reason to carefully insulate things. It was used to conduct an experiment or do a demonstration and then pack up and go. 

The only thing they really cared about was not inadvertantly shocking themselves when they weren't planning on it. There were many insulations for doing it.  In 1767, CL Epinasse even provided a recipe in 
"Description of an Improved Apparatus for Performing Electrical Experiments, in Which the Electrical Power is Increased, the Operator Intirely Secured from Receiving Any Any Accidental Shocks, and the Whole Rendered More Convenient for Experiments Than Heretofore"

Here you can do this at home,

Take 4lb of Venice turpentine, 1lb of resin, 1lb of bee's wax; boil these over a gentle fire, stirring them now and then for about six hours, at the end of which, stir in a quarter of a pound of vermilion, ou : then, a little of the mixture being taken
out and left to cool, will be hard and brittle ; a token that it is fit for use. Having well heated your globe or cylinder, pour the melted mixture into it ; turn the cylinder about so as to spread it evenly over the inside surface to the thickness of a sixpence, and let it cool very gradually."

The recommendations to this for actual wires started appearing in the late 1700s and early 1800s as applications for a stable installation of electricity became necessary. 

So this is a great example of how people with modern eyes will so desperately want to see something that really, in the context of the historical times, didn't make much sense. 

The electrical wire is here and done. The stable electric network is still far off in the future.

So are we done? 

ALMOST.

I have to talk about Benjamin Franklin. Well Kind of. Just like Watson duplicated LeMonnier, Franklin duplicated Watson. He too had Leyden Jars but he was electrocuting new world animals like wild turkeys.

Benjamin Franklin is a super important figure in the timeline of electricity. We've all heard the story of him 
flying the kite with the key in the lightning storm when we were children and you can be forgiven if you just filed this away with Washington's Cherry Tree and Johnny Appleseed as fun stories we tell children. I forgive you as well. 

It's time to refile that now though. Franklin won the Copley medal, the same one that Desaguliers and Gray won, for his work on Electricity. He did a number of publications in Philosophical Transactions concerning electricity. He had 17 publications in the journal in fact, a highly respectable number seeing as I could never in my wildest dreams even fathom getting just 1.  Franklin's electricity work is so important, in fact, that texts written before the American Revolution on the history of Electricity, such as say The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original Experiments, by Joseph Priestley, from 1769, Franklin's experiments in Philadelphia play pivotal roles.  For instance, Priestly title's Chapter 8 as "The history of electricity from the discovery of the Leyden phial in the years 1745 and 1746, till Dr. Franklin's Discoveries' and then writes all of Chapter 9 about Franklin, and concludes the book about the new ways people looked at electricity in a post Franklin world. Now remember, this is before the American Revolution, 1769, these aren't people star struck by his politics doing classical mythmaking.

So after all that praise, we are actually going to skip right over Franklin because we're focused exclusively on our journey to a working telegraph and Franklin doesn't actually play a role in that story. Don't worry, he will pop up again later. Also, I'm at episode 5 of a computing history podcast and still stuck in the 1750s. I do actually intend on eventually getting to things like strowger switches and reed relays, designed in the 1930s for telephone switches and arguably the first computer memory, sometime before an expanding sun swallows the earth. 

Alright ok, one thing about Franklin. Franklin greatly expanded upon Du Fay's observation of vitreous and resinous electricity and felt forced to give them a more generalized name, one that we still use today: positive, and negative. Well kinda. Watson used a plus and minus in diagrams for simplicity purposes and Franklin was like "ok, that makes sense. Positive and Negative it is!" Sorry DuFay, your resinous and vitreous came and went in a single episode.

So here we are, reliable insulated, electric wires going over multiple miles. This discovery will exhibit a pattern we'll see repeatedly, the time between discovery and the introduction of a so-called killer app, a term coined in a 1988 issue of Pc Week, it's the thing that chaparones a technology from a toy to a tool - a practical goal made easier by the technology. This is also the distinction that David Davidow in his 1986 text, "Marketing High Technology" made between a device and a product:

"Thousands of devices are invented every year...all the marketing hype in the world can't create a product unless a device exists. But the key is to convert great devices into great products.

Everyone knows what a product is. A product is the totality of what a customer buys. When a device is properly augmented so that it can be easily used by a customer it becomes a product"

We have the devices of electricity and wires, the separation between positive and negative, conductor and insulator, but no product has yet emerged. The time period between device and product is that of the enthusiast and hobbyist. It's the time before the first spreadsheet when people assembled personal computers from kits as a pasttime. 

So next time we will go into the era when electricity was merely pasttime and party trick before the first product of the electric era emerged.

Yes, we're done for real now. Phew, I'm exhuasted.

Joseph Franz Vienna 1500 feet iron wire

Watson glass globes and tubes do not posess in themselves electrical power, electrical fluid takes shortest couse, passing through the substance of the best medium of connection, discharging a phial through a wire covered with wax and resin.

Dr . Watson , in 1747 , in the presence of many scientific persons , transmitted the power through 2800 feet of wire and 8000 feet of water , thus employing in his experiments the use of the earth circuit . Afterwards , on the 14th of August , 1747 , Dr . Watson conducted an experiment on a much larger scale at Shooter ' s Hill . The wire was insulated by baked wood , and was 10 , 600 feet or nearly 2 miles long .
