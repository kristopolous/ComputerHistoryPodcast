Immortal Halley! thy unwearied soul 
On Wisdom's pinion flew from pole to pole, 
The uncertain compass to its task restored, 
Each ocean fathom’d, and each wind explored, 
Commanded trade with every breeze to fly, 
And gave to Britain half the Zemblian sky. 
And see, he comes, distinguish’d, loved, caress'd, 
Mark'd by each eye, and hugg'd to every breast; 
His godlike labours wit and science fire, 
All factions court him, and all sects admire; 
While Britain, with a gratitude unknown 
To every age but Nero's and our own, 
A gratitude that will for ever shame 
The Spartan glory, and the’ Athenian name
Tell it, ye winds! that all the world may hear-
Bless'd his old age with-ninety pounds a year.
Are these our triumphs? these the sums we give
to ripen genius, and to bid it live?
Can britian in her fits of mandness pour
One half her Indies on a Roman whore,
And still permit the weeping Muse to tell
how poor neglected Desaguliers fell?
How he, who taught two gracious kings to view
All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew,
Died in a cell, without a friend to save,
Without a guinea, and without a grave?

James Cawthorn, The Vanity Of Human Enjoyment, 1749.

18th century England threw so little cash toward science that even the poets were writing about it.

  Dr . Watson , in 1747 , in the presence of many scientific persons , transmitted the power through 2800 feet of wire and 8000 feet of water , thus employing in his experiments the use of the earth circuit . Afterwards , on the 14th of August , 1747 , Dr . Watson conducted an experiment on a much larger scale at Shooter ' s Hill . The wire was insulated by baked wood , and was 10 , 600 feet or nearly 2 miles long .

Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.5, the journey to the electric wire part deux.
In 1.3 we went over two, and now I'm showing my cards, carefully cherry picked publications by Stephen Gray; the first one involving children suspended by what he called hairlines and the second being a long line of thread being switchbacked to show that electricity follows the line all the way to its end.

We also talked about how Gray's experiments were really easy to reproduce, unlike say, Francis Hauksbee's air pump, a device to create a small ball without any air in it to run vacuum measurements. The air pump was pretty useful but apparently quite costly to make. Many early scientists talked about having to borrow other people's pumps and how some of them kinda didn't work very well. Not with Gray though. Suspending someone with some thread? Totally doable. A long line of thread suspended by silk? Yes, that too.

So what happened?

That's right, people did it. Let's talk about one of them in particular, a chemist and superintendent of the royal garden who died of smallpox at the age of 40. Now if you think that sounded very French, you'd be right. The Parisian Charles François de Cisternay du Fay, inspired by the two experiments of Mr. Gray we spoke of last time, repeated them in Paris.

Many of his findings were reported in the French Academy of Sciences, which got completely dismantled in the French Revolution and replaced with something effectively the same about 2 years later, because, the french revolution. But that's still 50 years in the future.

If french is your thing you can read his 30 page article in Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences published in 1733. There's a link in the show notes.

And if French isn't your thing, Du Fay happened to have been kind enough to have written essentially the same findings in an english document in Philosophical Transactions.

The first replicated experiment we're going to talk about I didn't go over last time but when I read what Du Fay had to say about it I just couldn't leave it out.
Gray had run a number of experiments which really made it look like color had something to do with how something responded to electricity.

Du Fay took 9 identical silk ribbons of different colors and then had a single glass tube that he brought near each of them at the same exact time, at the same exact distance. He noticed that the black one reacted first, every time. He rearranged the order of the ribbons and it was the same. After the black came the white and then an order of colors that always repeated itself. This was identical to what Gray had found.

Next he took pieces of colored cotton gauze and gold leaf and moved the gause pieces near the gold leaf and saw a different, but utterly repeatable pattern. This does sound like great evidence.

However, we all know, I think all of us do at least, that the color of something doesn't affect its electric properties. But how can we show that?  If you'd like to think this through, press pause and come back and see if you can think of Du Fay's next experiment.

Alright, I hope you had a fun time thinking that through. Du Fay used a prism. He threw various colors of the prism on different pieces of white gause, and there was no difference in attraction. He also warmed and wetted the gauses and silks and then saw the color differences go away. So he concludes "this difference proceeds not from the color but from the substances that are employed in the dying". Brilliant. He then used different methods of coloring, charcoal, carmine, and showed that it was a property of the chemicals of the dye, not of the colors.

So Gray made a correct, repeatable observation, but drew from it the wrong conclusion. This is great science. I'm excited, are you? Good, me too!

But wait, we're only 1/3 through Du Fay's paper.  Next he does Gray's packthread line experiment but Du Fay has the idea that by wetting the thread he could get a better connection. Then using glass tubes instead of silk for better support, Du Fay makes 8 returns through a garden. He achieves 1256 feet in high winds even, which is around twice what Gray did. Now Du Fay doesn't actually mention *which* garden he was using but he did say, 8 returns, crossed over 2 sidewalks, 1256 feet. So I looked up old maps of the royal garden and yes, there was an obvious long clearing about 160 feet wide crossing over 2 sidewalks so he probably did it at his office. It's cool Du Fay, I'm not going to run off and tell King Louis XIII, don't worry. Investigative reporting on a mostly irrelevant 287 year old science experiment, you must be tuning into the Computing History podcast.

Moving on, Du Fay also suspended a child and repeated Gray's experiments. But then he took it a step further and suspended himself by the silk lines as well. And I'm going to quote the next part because it's important:

"while I am suspended on the lines, if the electric tube be put near one of my hands, or my legs, and then if another person approches me, [podcasters note, that other person he's referring to is Abbe Nollet who will be important later] ... anyway, another person approaches me and passes his hand within an inch of my face, legs, hand or cloathes, there immediately issues from my body one or more pricking shoots, with a crackling noise, that causes that person as well as my self, a little pain. Pain resembling that from the sudden prick of a pin, or the burning from a Spark of Fire...And in the dark, these snappings are, as may be easily imagined, so many sparks of fire" 

We have electric spark. There it is. Du Fay, 1733. This is all in one paper, what the hell Du Fay. Let's move on. 

Du Fay next talks about two distinct electricities, very different from one another. The first he called vitreous, which means "glass-like" and the other one "resinous". He then notes that vitreous electrics, such as glass, rock-crystal and wool repel other vitreous electrics while resinous, such as amber, silk, and paper, repels other resinous. And that vitreous and resinous attract each other. Two electrified silks will repel, two woolen threads will repel, but a silk and a wool, those attract. 

There's even more but really, we just collected everything we came for so we must move on.

It wasn't just the English and French having all the Science fun here. The Germans are also going to get in on the action. Now for all the history nerds out there, yes, there technically is no Germany yet. And for the rest of you, Germany in the 1700s is a complete mess, you have the holy roman empire, saxony, bavaria, the austrian netherlands, hanover, brandenburg, and oh yeah, the hungarians had a good chunk of things as well ... Instead of trying to get any of this correct, when we talk about the scientists of central europe we're going to use whatever nationality english texts of the time referred to them as. I think that's fair. Same things go with the Italians, which is even messier. In fact, the two little enclaves of San Marino and Vatican City still haven't hopped on the Italian unification train.


Watson 1747, Thames river

If this sounds confusing don't worry, Scientific American did an engraving of his experiment in a supplemental from October 1889 that I just happened to have posted in the show notes at comphistpod.com

Franklin comes in through Waton's Experiements.

Also I must point out that Benjamin Franklin is a super important figure in the timeline of electricity. We've all heard the story of him 
flying the kite with the key in the lightning storm when we were children and you can be forgiven if you just filed this away with Washington's Cherry Tree and Johnny Appleseed as fun stories we tell children. I forgive you as well. 

It's time to refile that now though. Franklin won the Copley medal, the same one that Desaguliers and Gray won, for his work on Electricity. He did a number of publications in Philosophical Transactions concerning electricity. He had 17 publications in the journal in fact, a highly respectable number seeing as I could never in my wildest dreams even fathom getting just 1.  Franklin's electricity work is so important, in fact, that texts written before the American Revolution on the history of Electricity, such as say The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original Experiments, by Joseph Priestley, from 1769, Franklin's experiments in Philadelphia play pivotal roles.  For instance, Priestly title's Chapter 8 as "The history of electricity from the discovery of the Leyden phial in the years 1745 and 1746, till Dr. Franklin's Discoveries' and then writes all of Chapter 9 about Franklin, and concludes the book about the new ways people looked at electricity in a post Franklin world. Now remember, this is before the American Revolution, 1769, these aren't people star struck by his politics doing classical mythmaking.

So after all that praise, we are actually going to skip right over Franklin because we're focused exclusively on our journey to a working telegraph and Franklin doesn't actually play a role in that story. Don't worry, he will pop up again later. Also, I'm at episode 5 of a computing history podcast and still stuck in the 1750s. I do actually intend on eventually getting to things like strowger switches and reed relays, designed in the 1930s for telephone switches and arguably the first computer memory, sometime before an expanding sun swallows the earth. 

Alright ok, one thing. Franklin greatly expanded upon Du Fay's observation of vitreous and resinous electricity and felt forced to give them a more generalized name, one that we still use today: positive, and negative.

they were felt from a man's head to his foot, so that a person could
hardly take them without falling down with giddiness; and small
birds were killed by them.
This he effected by conveying elec-

Watson glass globes and tubes do not posess in themselves electrical power, electrical fluid takes shortest couse, passing through the substance of the best medium of connection, discharging a phial through a wire covered with wax and resin.

So here we are, reliable insulated, electric wires going over multiple miles. This discovery will exhibit a pattern we'll see repeatedly, the time between discovery and the introduction of a so-called killer app, a term coined in a 1988 issue of Pc Week, it's the thing that chaparones a technology from a toy to a tool - a practical goal made easier by the technology. This is also the distinction that David Davidow in his 1986 text, "Marketing High Technology" made between a device and a product:

"Thousands of devices are invented every year...all the marketing hype in the world can't create a product unless a device exists. But the key is to convert great devices into great products.

Everyone knows what a product is. A product is the totality of what a customer buys. When a device is properly augmented so that it can be easily used by a customer it becomes a product"

We have the devices of electricity and wires, the separation between positive and negative, conductor and insulator, but no product has yet emerged. The time period between device and product is that of the enthusiast and hobbyist. It's the time before the first spreadsheet when people assembled personal computers from kits as a pasttime. 

So next week we will go into the era when electricity was merely pasttime and party trick and before the first product of the electric era emerged.
