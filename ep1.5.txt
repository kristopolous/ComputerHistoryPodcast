Immortal Halley! thy unwearied soul 
On Wisdom's pinion flew from pole to pole, 
The uncertain compass to its task restored, 
Each ocean fathom’d, and each wind explored, 
Commanded trade with every breeze to fly, 
And gave to Britain half the Zemblian sky. 
And see, he comes, distinguish’d, loved, caress'd, 
Mark'd by each eye, and hugg'd to every breast; 
His godlike labours wit and science fire, 
All factions court him, and all sects admire; 
While Britain, with a gratitude unknown 
To every age but Nero's and our own, 
A gratitude that will for ever shame 
The Spartan glory, and the’ Athenian name
Tell it, ye winds! that all the world may hear-
Bless'd his old age with-ninety pounds a year.
Are these our triumphs? these the sums we give
to ripen genius, and to bid it live?
Can britian in her fits of mandess pour
One half her Indies on a Roman whore,
And still permit the weeping Muse to tell
how poor neglected Desaguliers fell?
How he, who taught two gracious kings to view
All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew,
Died in a cell, without a friend to save,
Without a guinea, and without a grave?

James Cawthorn, The Vanity Of Human Enjoyment, 1749.

"It caused great wonder and dread, which arose chiefly from the excited imagination. Musschenbroek felt the shock, and declared in a letter to a friend that he would not take a second one for the crown of France.

Bleeding at the nose, ardent fever, a heaviness of head which endured for days, were all ascribed to the shock. Boze wished that he might die of it, so the he might enjoy the honor of having his death chronicled in the Paris' Academy of Science.

Priestley says (" Discovery of Germans,
"
that Gordon
increased the electric sparks to such a degree that
they were felt from a man's head to his foot, so that a person could
hardly take them without falling down with giddiness; and small
birds were killed by them.
This he effected by conveying elec-
tricity, with iron wires, to the distance of 200 ells (about 250 yards)

from the place of excitation."
