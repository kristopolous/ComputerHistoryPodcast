Immortal Halley! thy unwearied soul 
On Wisdom's pinion flew from pole to pole, 
The uncertain compass to its task restored, 
Each ocean fathom’d, and each wind explored, 
Commanded trade with every breeze to fly, 
And gave to Britain half the Zemblian sky. 
And see, he comes, distinguish’d, loved, caress'd, 
Mark'd by each eye, and hugg'd to every breast; 
His godlike labours wit and science fire, 
All factions court him, and all sects admire; 
While Britain, with a gratitude unknown 
To every age but Nero's and our own, 
A gratitude that will for ever shame 
The Spartan glory, and the’ Athenian name
Tell it, ye winds! that all the world may hear-
Bless'd his old age with-ninety pounds a year.
Are these our triumphs? these the sums we give
to ripen genius, and to bid it live?
Can britian in her fits of mandness pour
One half her Indies on a Roman whore,
And still permit the weeping Muse to tell
how poor neglected Desaguliers fell?
How he, who taught two gracious kings to view
All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew,
Died in a cell, without a friend to save,
Without a guinea, and without a grave?

James Cawthorn, The Vanity Of Human Enjoyment, 1749.

18th century England threw so little cash toward science that even the poets were writing about it.

  "vitreous" and "resinous" --- was this desaguliers? Wikipedia says dufay
  - du fay is 1733, that's pretty good.

  Hausen's Electric machine

Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.5, the journey to the electric wire part deux.

Also I must point out that Benjamin Franklin is a super important figure in the timeline of electricity. We've all heard the story of him 
flying the kite with the key in the lightning storm when we were children and you can be forgiven if you just filed this away with Washington's Cherry Tree and Johnny Appleseed as fun stories we tell children. I forgive you as well. 

It's time to refile that now though. Franklin won the Copley medal, the same one that Desaguliers and Gray won, for his work on Electricity. He did a number of publications in Philosophical Transactions concerning electricity. He had 17 publications, a highly respectable number seeing as I've never in my wildest dreams could ever fathom getting 1, and most of them having to do with electricity. He's so important, in fact, that texts well before the American Revolution on the history of Electricity, such as say The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original Experiments, by Joseph Priestley, from 1769, Franklin and his experiments in Philadelphia are seen as pivotal roles.  For isntance, Chapter 8's title is "The history of electricity from the discovery of the Leyden phial in the years 1745 and 1746, till Dr. Franklin's Discoveries' and all of Chapter 9 is about Franklin, then the final chapter is all about a post Franklin world. Now remember, this is before the American Revolution, 1769, these aren't people star struck by his politics doing classical mythmaking.

Now after all this, we are actually going to skip right over him because we're focused exclusively on our journey to a working telegraph and Franklin doesn't play a role in that story. Also, I'm at episode 5 of a computing history podcast and still stuck in the 1750s --- any outsider would justifiably accuse me of total ignorance and insanity.  Wear those labels proudly, normalcy is a waste of time.

"It caused great wonder and dread, which arose chiefly from the excited imagination. Musschenbroek felt the shock, and declared in a letter to a friend that he would not take a second one for the crown of France.

Bleeding at the nose, ardent fever, a heaviness of head which endured for days, were all ascribed to the shock. Boze wished that he might die of it, so the he might enjoy the honor of having his death chronicled in the Paris' Academy of Science.

Priestley says (" Discovery of Germans,
"
that Gordon
increased the electric sparks to such a degree that
they were felt from a man's head to his foot, so that a person could
hardly take them without falling down with giddiness; and small
birds were killed by them.
This he effected by conveying elec-
tricity, with iron wires, to the distance of 200 ells (about 250 yards)

from the place of excitation."

Vitreous is glass, resinous is ground, positive and negative.

Watson glass globes and tubes do not posess in themselves electrical power, electrical fluid takes shortest couse, passing through the substance of the best medium of connection, discharging a phial through a wire covered with wax and resin.
