Hello and welcome to computing history episode 1.2.

Let's talk about electricity.

It's fast. In the 1700s it was considered to effectively be instantaneous.

Prior to our floating alphabetic rips of paper we discussed in 1.1, Stephen
Grey did a number of experiments.

It's hard what to think about Stephen Grey. In A History of Science,
published in 1904, Henry Williams referred to him as an irascible old
pensioner. Over on Wikipedia one editor said that he was a shadow of his
adviser John Theophilus Desaguliers who stole the limelight.

However if you read Desaguliers "A Dissertation Concerning Electricity", a
list of 24 different experiments to observe the phenomena of electricity, the
author speaks quite glowingly of Stephen Grey.

Regardless, we'll be focusing on two letters he wrote in January and February
of 1731 that were published in Philisophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, a scientific journal that started in 1665.  Back then you just wrote
a letter, in prose to Cromwell Mortimer, the secretary of the journal, in freeform
discribing your experiments.

He'd read over it and be like "eh, cool - doesn't look like nonsense" and it'd
be typeset and published in the next issue... and that's all it took. 

There wasn't a lot of social capital tied to being published in a
science journal. The push kinda came from the other direction, the journals
wanted to make sure they were able to dissiminate to their readership any new
scientific observations so they wanted to make sure they got a record of all
of them.

This meant a lot of the articles were basically "I brought a bunch of things into a room,
tried some experiments a few times, some weird things happened and then I
tried it again, and the wierd things happened again! In my excitement as I
continued observing the weirdness, I got ahead of myself and accidentally broke 
the stuff I was using to make the weird thing so I wasn't able to play with
it any more. Sincerely, some random dude. August 1st say 1721"

And that was what science looked like.  Often there'd be followups a few
months later that were basically like

"omg you guys totally flipped out about my description of the weird things. I got a 
bunch of letters where you tried numerous variations and also saw the weird stuff going on.
Isn't this exciting? Anyway, here's my encore presentation where I talk about more weird stuff."
